__How can I be a part of this awesome group?__

* __Board Member.__ As an investor from the very beginning, we understand that the risks are high - but so is the potential for high returns. OSF is currently searching for investors who are willing and able to contribute $20,000USD (around $120,000 RMB) upfront, part of which will fund the manager and entrepreneurs who will be working as staff members of the company. As a board member, you’ll have voting rights to all the major decisions made for the company, including which entrepreneurs to hire and how to allocate the existing funds. The fun part of it will be the opportunity to mentor young entrepreneurs and live vicariously through the excitement of building a new venture - while being rewarded with returns later on.

* __Outside Investor.__ If you’re excited about our idea and want to invest in it but don’t think you’ll have time to actively coach the entrepreneurs, you can invest some money in in exchange for limited voting rights (details to come)...

* __Advisor.__ As an advisor, you won’t be contributing any money to the fund. Instead, your contribution will be your knowledge and expertise - whether it’s in programming, investment, or any other relevant area, we certainly welcome outside opinions to what we’re doing and how we’re doing it. What’s more, you gain an enormous network of talented people across many different fields.

* __Entrepreneur.__ Entrepreneurs are the central piece of this fund: we’re looking for open-minded, passionate entrepreneurs who are already fairly skilled in programming and software development. It’s alright if you don’t have a startup idea in mind - as long as you’re open to collaborating with a group of like-minded people and willing to work hard, we want to hire you to be a part of our awesome team. You’ll benefit from a strong support network of engineers who are experienced in coding and can help out when you get stuck. You’ll also receive compensation in the combined form of salary and equity.
